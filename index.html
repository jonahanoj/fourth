            <h2 class="subtitle is-6">By Jonah Gann</h2>
            <p>
              It was the year 2056. There was a spy organization that had just finished being built. It was time to hire
              some people. There were two kids, named David Kenler and Joshua Hackleburger. They were best friends.
              David and Joshua (whose nickname was Josh) always dreamed of being spies. They played games of being
              sneaky
              where they snuck into places that were evil and tried to break in and take back valuables from them. They
              would
              talk on their walkie talkies, saying things like “Hack into the control panel and turn off the laser
              barrier so I can get in.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Twenty-four years later (year 2080), David and Josh needed jobs. Remember that spy organization? Well,
              they were hiring again. The spy organization was called The Evergreen David saw a poster that read “The
              Evergreen spy organization (NOW HIRING!)” He asked Josh to come see it. They remembered that they wanted
              to be spies
              when they were kids. So they applied for the job!
            </p>
            <p>They had to take a test, sometime during the week, they had to sneak into one of the staff's houses and
              take something while there home. David did the test and succeeded! Josh on the other hand, did not. He
              failed and was caught. So, he tried again and failed again and again. On the twenty-seventh try, he
              finally did it! He was hired with David and a girl named Jacky. David, Josh and Jacky were Team B. One
              month
              later,they had their first mission, where they had to sneak into an evil headquarters called “The
              Darkeners,” to
              take back a powerful laser. When they got there, something seemed wrong because no one was there. They
              looked around and saw someone talking to a skinny guy. They listened in with their spy gear. They got the
              info they needed and told their spy leader, Mrs. Beth. They told her that it was in a place called “The
              Rock”. She told them that The Rock was a bar that sold soda, but no one liked their soda. So the place was
              abandoned and never to be heard of. She told them the location and they were off! When they got there,
              they were confused. They were in a forest and saw no bar. There were vines everywhere and everything was
              overgrown. Then Josh found something behind the vines. There was some wood! They went in even deeper and
              found a door! Or what used to be a door…</p>
            <p>They went in. There was a gray metal suitcase. They pulled up the latches, but it didn’t open. Then they
              saw a keyhole! They grabbed the suitcase and brought it back to HQ. When they got back, they got a drill
              and made a hole in the suitcase. They could see the laser! They brought it back to Mrs. Beth and she
              turned
              the laser on.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What are you doing!?” screamed David. It burnt a hole in the lock, and then she opened it. “I know what
              I’m doing,” Mrs. Beth said. She took the laser out and told them to bring it to the vault and then come
              back.
              So they did. When they came back, Mrs. Beth was gone! They then saw a hole in the window! They looked
              through
              it and saw someone carrying Mrs. Beth! She was all tied up, so they got the laser out of the vault and
              snuck
              up behind him. Jacky found a smoke bomb and threw it at the man. The man could not see, so they grabbed
              Mrs.
              Beth and David burned the rope with the laser. Josh asked, “Who was that!?” “It was one of the Darkener
              agents,” she said. So they then went into lockdown. The Darkeners were HERE. They searched the base to see
              if any
              broke in. They saw someone go into the vault and stole gems and gold! They saw him on camera, but he got
              away.
              So they gave up for a while and looked for clues. Later one of the Team c members found all of their
              valuables being sold on eBay. He showed Mrs. Beth immediately and she was shocked. So they scheduled a
              meet-up to
              buy the stolen items but they had to have a disguise. So Josh dressed up and got a new name, Henry. When
              they
              went up to him, he showed them the valuables, then “Henry” just took it and ran. The man who was selling
              the
              items chased Josh and then took him to their dungeon. There were high-tech prison doors and he was locked
              in.
              However, he had back-up. He got out his walkie-talkie and told David where he was, so they could sneak in.
              They were able to get Josh out using the laser, but when they were cutting the metal door, a guard came
              out!
              Luckily, they hid so he couldn't see them. Then the guard walked away, and they got him out. After that,
              they went back to base, and got all of the teams (Team, A, B, C, D, E, F and G.) Then, they asked a
              different
              spy organization called “The Pine” to help them. They all got ready to raid The Darkeners to put them in
              jail.
              The teams all went and put them in jail. They used the laser to open their vault and they retrieved the
              valuables!

            <h1 class="title is-4">The Lighthouse</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle is-6">By Jonah Gann</h2>
            <p>
              Isaac and Chloe were siblings in a family of four. They lived in Maryland in a cabin in the forest by the
              ocean. There was an abandoned lighthouse by the shore. Its bulb was broken, its windows were shattered,
              and
              worst of all some people said that… it was haunted! Their parents said to never go inside. It was super
              broken and it could collapse at any minute! Some say that a wolf lives there but no one knows for sure.
              Isaac really wanted to go to the lighthouse but the rest of the family said no. So that night, Isaac was
              planning to sneak out. Night came and it was Isaac’s bed time. His parents tucked him in and said
              goodnight.
              Then, Isaac came out of bed and opened his window and snuck out. But, what he didn’t think of is that his
              sister frequently had nightmares and walks to his room and she did. Chloe wondered where he was and then
              she
              saw that the window was open. She was confused. Then, she looked out the window and saw the lighthouse’s
              door was open! She went to the front door and opened it up and went to the lighthouse, worried for her
              brother.
            </p>
            <p>
              Isaac went to see the bulb at the top floor. Isaac was quite the engineer and he was 14 years old.
            </p>
            <p>His curiosity as an engineer led him to try and fix the bulb. A while later, he had almost fixed it when
              his sister found him. “Why did you sneak out?!” said Chloe. “And why are you at the lighthouse? Mom and
              dad
              said to never go here!”</p>

            <p>“Done!” said Isaac and the bulb turned on.
              “Woah!” said Chloe, amazed.
              “Please don’t tell Mom and Dad,” said Isaac. “I wanna make this place look good.”
              “Fine,” said Chloe and they went home.
            </p>


            <p>
              The next day Chloe and Isaac went to the store and bought windows. Then, when night came they went to the
              lighthouse again. They put up the windows in the lighthouse but then they heard a wolf howl. They were
              terrified and they saw a shadow of a wolf. They thought it was the end. Then they saw the wolf. But it was
              just a baby! They named it Max and kept it as a pet in the lighthouse. But the next day their parents went
              stargazing and saw the lighthouse bulb was on! They went into the lighthouse and went to the top. They saw
              Isaac and Chloe and Max and they were mad. Chloe and Isaac were grounded for 3 weeks. But the family kept
              on
              building the lighthouse and they kept Max. A while later when the lighthouse was almost done Max was
              sniffing
              the floor looking for food. Then he found a secret trapdoor. Max started barking at it so the family went
              over. Chloe opened up the trapdoor and inside there was a bunch of sciency stuff. “What is all this?!”
              said
              isaac.
              “I don’t know,” said his mom. “It looks like a lab of some sort.”
              “Should we leave it here and ignore it? Or should we clean it up and make it like the rest of the
              lighthouse?”
              Said the dad.
              “I think we should leave it,” said Chloe. “It looks like someone has been here recently.”
              “How do you know?” said Isaac.
              “Look at this coffee mug, it still has coffee in it and it's still warm,” said Chloe.
              “What a detective!” said Dad.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Shhhh!” said the mom “Someone is coming!” They all hid under a table.
              A guy in a white lab coat came in and sat down at the table that they were under and picked up his coffee
              and took a slurp. Everyone was shaking terrified that he would see them. Then he left. They wanted to see
              what he was up to, so they started setting up a security camera. But, when they were almost done, he came
              back.
              “Who are you?” he said “Oh! You must be my test subjects.”
              Mom said, “Oh, ummm... we’re not your test subjects. We live here.”
              “No, I live here,” said the scientist. “You must be the people who made my lighthouse look better!”
              “Yes we are,” said Dad
              “How about we have a deal,” said the scientist. “You can live here since you made it look great. But, you
              have to let me live in the lab, ok?”
              “Deal!” said Mom and Dad.
            </p>

            <p>
              One day, the scientist made a portal to another dimension.
              He called them down to the lab, and everyone said the portal looked cool then they all went in. When they
              came through it was dark and hot. For some reason it was also slippery.
              They were standing on ice! But then why was it hot? Then they saw a light in a cave so they came in. Why
              was
              it light in a cave but dark outside? Then, they realized. They were in a parallel dimension! It's light in
              dark places and dark in light places and hot in cold places and probably cold in hot places! Then they
              went
              back through the portal as it was closing up. It probably wasn't safe there anyway.
              So they lived with the scientist and he made great coffee, but something was off about him. He acted
              strange. Yes, some scientists are strange, but this guy was crazy. He was like… a MAD scientist. He got
              squirrels from the woods and turned them into small hippos! Why? I do not know, but he used them as
              slaves.
              The family did not approve of that, so they released the squippos (squirrel hippos) one by one, under his
              nose. Until one day, he caught them releasing one. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?” he said. “ARE YOU AGAINST ME?!
              I'M
              TRYING TO GET AN ARMY OF SQUIPPOS!”
              “We are releasing them because you are using them as slaves!” said Chloe angrily. “I’m calling 911!”
              “NO!” said the scientist. He tried to whack the phone out of her hand. But he missed, and face planted
              into
              the floor! He fell unconscious. A moment later he woke up but they didn’t want him getting away. Then Max
              started barking and growling at him and pinned him down. A while later the police came and brought him to
              jail. After that, they started making the lab look like the rest of the lighthouse. They were going to
              sell
              the lab stuff on ebay, but didn’t want it getting into the wrong hands so they kept it hidden in a
              compartment in the lab. They finished the lighthouse a month later. They got famous. They got their own
              book
              about their story and that is the book you just finished.
